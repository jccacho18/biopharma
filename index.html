              <h3>Health benefits of taking probiotics</h3>
              <p>
                What are the benefits of taking probiotics? Bacteria have a
                reputation for causing disease, so the idea of tossing down a
                few billion a day for your health might seem — literally and
                figuratively — hard to swallow. But a growing body of scientific
                evidence suggests that you can treat and even prevent some
                illnesses with foods and supplements containing certain kinds of
                live bacteria.

              <h3>What are probiotics?</h3>
              <p>
                Probiotics are live microorganisms that are intended to have
                health benefits when consumed or applied to the body. They can
                be found in yogurt and other fermented foods, dietary
                supplements, and beauty products.

              <h3>Human gut study questions probiotic health benefits</h3>
              <p>
                Probiotics are found in everything from chocolate and pickles to
                hand lotion and baby formula, and millions of people buy
                probiotic supplements to boost digestive health. But new
                research suggests they might not be as effective as we think.
                Through a series of experiments looking inside the human gut,
                researchers show that many people's digestive tracts prevent
                standard probiotics from successfully colonizing them.
                Furthermore, taking probiotics to counterbalance antibiotics
                could delay the return of normal gut bacteria and gut gene
                expression to their naïve state. The research publishes as two
                back-to-back papers on September 6 in the journal Cell.
