                <h3>Health benefits of taking probiotics</h3>
                <p>What are the benefits of taking probiotics? 
                Bacteria have a reputation for causing disease, 
                so the idea of tossing down a few billion a day for your 
                health might seem — literally and figuratively — hard to swallow. 
                But a growing body of scientific evidence suggests 
                that you can treat and even prevent some illnesses 
                with foods and supplements containing certain kinds
                 of live bacteria. </p>

                <h3>What are probiotics?</h3>
                <p>Probiotics are live microorganisms that are 
                intended to have health benefits when consumed 
                or applied to the body. They can be found in yogurt 
                and other fermented foods, dietary supplements, 
                and beauty products.</p>

                <h3>Human gut study questions probiotic health benefits</h3>
                <p>Probiotics are found in everything from chocolate 
                and pickles to hand lotion and baby formula, 
                and millions of people buy probiotic supplements 
                to boost digestive health. But new research suggests 
                they might not be as effective as we think. 
                Through a series of experiments looking inside the human gut, 
                researchers show that many people's digestive tracts 
                prevent standard probiotics from successfully colonizing them. 
                Furthermore, taking probiotics to counterbalance 
                antibiotics could delay the return of normal gut bacteria 
                and gut gene expression to their naïve state. 
                The research publishes as two back-to-back papers on 
                September 6 in the journal Cell.</p>
